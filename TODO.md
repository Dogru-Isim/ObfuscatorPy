### Problems:

- `ObfuscatorPy.py`
  
  - Fix the weird `Entry-Point DLLRegisterServer was not found` error (DLL still runs with `regsvr32.exe`) (Is it on my end?)

### Features:

- Implement other kinds of injection methods (I want this new MAC address formatted injection)

- Implement injection methods with different programming languages (Rust seems cool)

- Implement built-in icon changer (no icon is pretty sus don't you think?)
